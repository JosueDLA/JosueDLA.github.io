# Introduction to Webpack with TypeScript

Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. Made mainly for JavaScript, but it can be used to transform front-end files like HTML, CSS and Images with the corresponding loaders.

Webpack takes the dependencies and generates a graphic of dependencies that allows developers to use a modular approach. It can be used from the command line or configure it with a file called `webpack.config.js`.

```bash
> npm i webpack webpack-cli ts-loader -D
```

## webpack.config.js

This file is used to define rules, plugins etc. for a project – webpack can be enhanced with rules that allows developers to customize tasks -.
This file must be in the root directory of our project – the same folder as the `package.json` – If necessary the path can be changed using the parameter `–config` when calling webpack via command line.
`Webpack-config.js` uses the node module system since this will be the one in charge of reading and bundle our project.

## Basic structure of Webpack.config.js

```javascript
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.ts",
  output: {
    filename: "app.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
  },
};
```

- **entry:** is the main file of our project, this is a relative route based on the location of the webpack.config.js file.
- **output:** this object contains output configuration options of our project.
- **filename:** is the name of the output file.
- **path:** is the absolute path of the directory where we store the output files.
- **mode:** provide the mode configuration - development or production -.
- **module:** defines the way loaders should behave.
- **plugins:** defines the plugins used in the project, allow us to enhance webpack capabilities.

## Webpack-dev-server

Webpack provides a development server called `webpack-dev-server` that can be used as a HTTP server to serve our output files while we develop. It also provides a live reloading capability.

```bash
> npm i webpack-dev-server -D
```

### Package.json

```json
//...
// webpack < 5
"scripts": {
  "develop": "webpack-dev-server",
  "build": "webpack --config ./webpack.config.js",
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
},
```

```json
//...
// webpack >= 5
"scripts": {
  "develop": "webpack serve",
  "build": "webpack --config ./webpack.config.js",
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
},
```

`Webpack-dev-server` recompile when changes are made in our code, but it doesn’t rebuild it by default. To fix this we need to tell `webpack-dev-server` where to output the rebuild code.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  // webpack < 5
  output: {
    publicPath: "dist", // Output folder
  },
};
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  // webpack >= 5
  devServer: {
    publicPath: "/",
    contentBase: "./dist",
    hot: true,
  },
};
```

- **publicPath:** The path where the files will be available.
- **contentBase:** Where content will be served.
- **hot:** enable hot module replacement.

## Resolve: Using ES6 Modules

This option define the way modules are resolve.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".ts", ".js"],
  },
};
```

### resolve.alias

creates aliases for import or require, allowing us to import modules easily.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      Utilities: path.resolve(__dirname, "src/utilities/"),
      Template: path.resolve(__dirname, "src/templates/"),
    },
  },
};
```

Now instead of importing using relative routes, we can do it using the aliases.

```javascript
import Utility from "../../utilities/utility";
```

```javascript
import Utility from "Utilities/utility";
```

## Source Maps

Source maps is a file that maps the source-code with the webpack compiled code, allowing developers to easily debug.

- **devtool:** this option controls if a source-map file is generated.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  devtool: "eval-source-map",
  //...
};
```

```json
//tsconfig.json
//...
"sourceMap": true,
```
