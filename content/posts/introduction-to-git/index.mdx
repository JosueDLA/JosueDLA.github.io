# Introduction to Git

Git is a version control software designed by Linus Torvalds, designed for efficiency and reliability of maintaining applications versions when they have many source-code files. Git purpose is to keep track of file changes and coordinate the work of several people on shared files.

- Git stores changes in a special database called a repository.
- Version Control allows you to track change history and work with a team.

## Version Control System

A Version Control System is a system that manages the various changes that are made to the elements of a product or its configuration. There are two types of version control systems:

- Centralized
- Distributed

### Centralized

In a centralized system, all the team must connect to the server to get the latest version of the code, and to share their changes (Ex. Subversion, Team Foundation Server).

### Distributed

In a distributed system, each member has a copy of the project, allowing snapshots to be saved locally; it also allows you to synchronize your work with other contributors (Ex. Git, Mercurial).

## Advantages of Using Git

- Itâ€™s free
- Open Source
- Fast
- Scalable
- Allows branching/merging

## Configuration Levels

Git allows us to configure it at different levels:

- **System:** All users
- **Global:** All repositories of the current user
- **Local:** The current repository

```shell
> git config --[level] [setting] "[name]"           # Command structure
> git config --global user.name "Jhon Doe"          # Set username
> git config --global user.email jhondoe@gmail.com  # Set user email
> git config --global core.editor "code --wait"     # Set default editor
```

### End of Lines

Its important to configure the end of line setting when working with a team that uses different Operating Systems, this is due to the way different Operating Systems manage end of lines. On Windows end of liens are marked with two characters `\r` and `\n` but on other operating systems such as MacOS and Linux end of lines are marked only with one character `\r`. To fix this we need to configure a setting called `core.autocrlf`. This setting will tell Git to manage end of line depending on which OS we are using.

```shell
> git config --global core.autocrlf input           # MacOS/Linux
> git config --global core.autocrlf true            # Windows
```
